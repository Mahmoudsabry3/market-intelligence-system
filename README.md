# Multi-Agent Market Intelligence System

## 1. System Overview

The Multi-Agent Market Intelligence System is an advanced, modular framework designed to automatically generate comprehensive market intelligence reports based on user queries. The system employs a chain of specialized agents, each responsible for a distinct phase in the report generation process, from query understanding to final report formatting.

The system aims to provide actionable market insights by collecting, analyzing, and synthesizing data from multiple sources including financial APIs, news articles, social media, and industry databases. It features robust fallback mechanisms to ensure operation even when external APIs are unavailable.

## 2. System Architecture

The system follows a sequential multi-agent architecture with four primary components:

```
User Query → Query Understanding Agent → Data Collection Agent → Data Analysis Agent → Report Generation Agent → Final Report
```

Each agent performs a specialized function in the pipeline:

1. **Query Understanding Agent**: Interprets natural language queries and extracts structured parameters.
2. **Data Collection Agent**: Gathers relevant market data from multiple sources.
3. **Data Analysis Agent**: Processes and analyzes the collected data to generate insights.
4. **Report Generation Agent**: Creates a formatted report based on the analyzed data.

## 3. Detailed Component Documentation

### 3.1 Query Understanding Agent

#### Purpose
Processes natural language queries and extracts structured information about markets and focus areas.

#### Input/Output
- **Input**: Natural language query string
- **Output**: Dictionary with structured query information

#### Implementation
```python
class QueryUnderstandingAgent:
    """
    First agent in the workflow that processes the user's high-level query
    and extracts structured information about the market and focus areas.
    
    Enhanced with simulated BERT-like NLP capabilities to better understand query intent,
    extract detailed parameters, and handle complex comparative queries.
    """
```

#### Key Methods

1. **`_extract_with_llm(query)`**: Uses OpenAI to extract entities and intent from queries.
   - Attempts to use a language model for sophisticated query understanding
   - Falls back to rule-based extraction if API is unavailable

2. **`_fallback_extraction(query)`**: Simulates BERT-like entity extraction as a fallback.
   - Identifies market, geography, timeframe, and focus areas
   - Uses pattern matching and predefined entity types

3. **`_simulate_intent_classification(query)`**: Determines the primary intent of the query.
   - Classifies into categories: market_analysis, competitive_analysis, trend_forecast, comparative_study
   - Uses keyword matching to determine the most likely intent

4. **`process(query)`**: Main entry point that orchestrates the query understanding process.
   - Applies advanced NLP techniques when available
   - Falls back to simulated capabilities when needed
   - Returns structured query with confidence score

#### Example Output
```python
{
    "intent": "trend_forecast",
    "parameters": {
        "market": "fintech",
        "focus": "trends",

Converts the generated report into PDF format for easy sharing and presentation.

#### Implementation
```python
def save_report_as_pdf(report_text, filename):
    """
    Save the generated report as a PDF file.
    """

- Falls back to HTML if PDF generation fails
- Provides a final fallback to plain text if needed

### 4.2 Process Query Function

#### Purpose
Orchestrates the entire workflow from user query to final report.

#### Implementation
```python
def process_query(query, save_pdf=True):
    """
    Main function that processes a user query through the entire agent workflow.
    """
```

#### Key Steps
1. Initializes all agent components
2. Processes the query through each agent sequentially
3. Saves the final report in PDF format if requested
4. Returns the formatted report string

## 5. Data Flow and Integration

The system maintains a consistent data structure throughout the pipeline, with each agent adding or transforming specific aspects:

1. **User Query (string)** → QueryUnderstandingAgent
2. **Structured Query (dict)** → DataCollectionAgent
3. **Collected Data (dict)** → DataAnalysisAgent
4. **Analyzed Data (dict)** → ReportGenerationAgent
5. **Final Report (string)** → PDF/HTML/Text Output

Integration with external services is managed through API clients:
- News API for article retrieval
- Yahoo Finance API for financial data
- Twitter API for social media sentiment
- Reddit API for forum discussions
- OpenAI API for summarization and analysis

Each external dependency includes robust fallback mechanisms to ensure system reliability even when APIs are unavailable.

## 6. Error Handling and Resilience

The system incorporates comprehensive error handling at multiple levels:

1. **API-Level Resilience**: All external API calls include try-except blocks with appropriate fallbacks.
2. **Service-Level Fallbacks**: When an entire service is unavailable, simulated data generation provides realistic alternatives.
3. **Exponential Backoff**: API retries use exponential backoff to handle rate limiting (e.g., in Yahoo Finance calls).
4. **Format Validation**: Data structure validation ensures consistent formats throughout the pipeline.
5. **Report Generation Fallbacks**: Multi-tier fallbacks for report saving (PDF → HTML → Text).

## 7. Usage Instructions
